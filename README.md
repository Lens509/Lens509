👋 About Me


I am a Data Science student with a strong interest in data analysis, machine learning, and building automated solutions. I enjoy turning raw data into meaningful insights and developing practical tools that solve real-world problems.

I regularly work on projects involving machine learning, data analysis, automation, and bot development, particularly in the areas of finance and algorithmic trading. Curious and self-motivated, I continuously seek to improve my technical skills and explore new technologies.
